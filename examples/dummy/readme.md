# Dummy examples

The examples in here are not actually doing any machine learning or use any machine learning framework. They simply use the logging features of dbx to create _fake_ experiments. The purpose of these examples is:

- to highlight different features of the dbx logger without adding any machine learning/deep learning into the equation
- to make it fast to generate a bunch of experiments and get familiar with the dbx command line tool to 'analyse' them
